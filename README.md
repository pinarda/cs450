This started as a project for CS450 - Computer Graphics at Oregon State University. We built a viewer that could read from a simple file format (.obj) listing sets of triangle vertices and render these as images, which we could then rotate, translate and scale. I improved this project by adding multiple different shader states (cel, gouraud, phong), more intuitive object manipulation, and improved the performance of the viewer by using VBOs and VAOs efficiently.
